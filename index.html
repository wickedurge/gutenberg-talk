                        Moving the content from a page builder to another site is very difficult. Your content and it's presentation become mixed together, and it's very hard to extract.

                        Gutenberg lets us not only have the kind of editing exprience that we need, it does it in a way that is open.

                    <section>
                        When Gutenberg is done, we'll be able to move content between Gutenberg compatible themes with few modifications.

                    <section>
                        Because Gutenberg mostly just adds html comments to our markup, our content is pretty separated from our presentation in a very portable way
